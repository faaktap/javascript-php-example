<p>
This is a test to create a menu structure that works via php and also without php
<br><br>
Currently we use a loader.php to work on the server, and to complete tasks we sent to it via javascript in our index file.
<pre><code>

.li.  .button.  onclick="loader('home')"  .Home.  ./button. ./li.

</code>

each item will have a PARENTNAMEID - like "TOP", "MENU1", SOCIALFEEDS", - these would be used to delve deeper if needed.
each item will have a method - this will be what we will do with this item 
each item will have a name - will be important for display on menu
each item will have an ID  - we use this for identification of the menu structure. and to issue commands.
each item could have a description - to tell use what this click will do
each item should have a attribute same as it;s method. method href will have attribute href, method menu should have attribute menu, etc.
(if id "faceb" is clicked, we see it's method is href and it href is a url.)

methods : menu - this is a menu item, and there must be stuff below it, linked to it's ID , we can also think about using "part2" as field, to show where it muse be displayed
