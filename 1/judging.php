            <p>Products will be judged in accordance with the variety or type (class) to which it
                belongs and in which it has been entered.</p>
            <p>The International 100 point OIV system is used.</p>
            <p>All products are judged ‘blind’, thus the judges aren’t aware of the origin of the
                product being adjudicated and aren’t influenced by product packaging.</p>
